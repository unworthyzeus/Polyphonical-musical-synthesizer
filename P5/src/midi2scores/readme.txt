This directory can be used to generated scores .sco from standard midi files.
If the file ./midi2skini works, you should be able to execute midi2sco.py.

If this does not work, you can re-compile using the sources found in midifile.zip
This is open source and you can find updated versions, but it is included here
to avoid dependencies with future changes.
